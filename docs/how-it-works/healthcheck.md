**Key File:** `pkg/healthcheck/healthcheck.go`

##  1. <a name='HowItWorks:'></a>How It Works:

Health Checks are a crucial feature that monitors the application's status and readiness, ensuring it is functioning correctly and is ready to handle requests. This feature provides endpoints that external systems can query to check the health and readiness of the application.

##  2. <a name='KeyResponsibilities:'></a>Key Responsibilities:

1. **Health Check Endpoints:**
   - The application exposes HTTP endpoints for health (`/healthz`) and readiness (`/readyz`). These endpoints provide information about the application's operational status.

2. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - The health check service regularly monitors the internal state of the application and updates the health and readiness status accordingly.

3. **Integration with Kubernetes:**
   - In a Kubernetes environment, these health check endpoints are used by Kubernetes to manage the application's lifecycle. Kubernetes can restart pods that fail health checks, ensuring continuous availability.

##  3. <a name='Benefits:'></a>Benefits:

- **Operational Reliability:**
  - Health checks ensure that the application is running correctly and can handle incoming requests. This reliability is critical for maintaining user trust and satisfaction.

- **Proactive Issue Detection:**
  - By regularly monitoring the application's status, health checks can detect issues early, allowing for proactive resolution before they impact users.

- **Kubernetes Compatibility:**
  - Health checks integrate seamlessly with Kubernetes, enabling automated management of the application's lifecycle. This integration helps maintain high availability and reduces downtime.
