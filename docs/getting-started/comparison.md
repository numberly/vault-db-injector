# Comparison

A vault injector retrieves credentials from a vault database engine and injects them into pods' environment variables. This document compares different existing tools with the new vault injector being developed.

## Summary

##  1. <a name='WhyVault-Db-Injector'></a>Why Vault-Db-Injector?

Before comparing Vault-Db-Injector with existing tools, we would like to share that we initially investigated various vault injector solutions designed to fetch credentials from Vault.

After extensive research, we found no tools that matched our needs, and most of them were difficult to contribute to.

Vault-Db-Injector is not a replacement for any existing vault injector but a tool more focused on security and the database engine.

We didn't intend to reinvent the wheel but designed a tool that perfectly matches our needs and shared it with those who might be interested.

##  2. <a name='ToolsComparison'></a>Tools Comparison

Here are the major tools that we compare our injector to:

- [Vault Agent Injector](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/injector)
- [Bank Vault](https://github.com/bank-vaults/bank-vaults)
- [Vals Operator](https://github.com/digitalis-io/vals-operator)
- [Vault CSI Provider](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/csi)

##  3. <a name='Ourneeds'></a>Our needs

Here are our needs by importance in our research : 

- Handle database engine
- Injection through environment variables
- Easy to use for developpers
- Audit logging
- Lease can be automatically renewed and revoked
- State is available for debugging purpose and manual revocation also
- Working with a single deployment
